        <h1>Blue Ketchup</h1>
		<p>A friend of mine (who actually did the js for this website) is oddly insistent that the best flavor is "blue", and everything blue tastes good. Not blue raspberry, but blue. She also has an intense hatred of ketchup.</p>
		<p>The hardest problem with making blue ketchup wasn't adding the blue, but rather removing the red. Our first attempt was trying to make ketchup from scratch and dye it blue, but even with lighter color tomatoes, yeilded a greenish, messy salsa-like product.</p>
		<p>The only record we could find of something similar was a reddit text post from several years ago mentioning clear ketchup made from a ketchup extract produced by putting ketchup in a rotovap and building it back up with corn syrup, water, and xanthan gum.</p>
