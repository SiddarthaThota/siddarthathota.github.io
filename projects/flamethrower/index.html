		<h1>Flamethrower</h1>

		<p>The idea for this project came about when a friend of mine mentioned that a flamethrower would be the most fitting weapon for me in a zombie apocalypse. This brought to my attention that I did not yet own a flamethrower, an injustice which I set out to remedy immediately. </p>

		<p>A goal of this project was to one-up the common DIY flamethrower design. As such, instead of using 1/2" NPT hose, 3/4" was used, and the gun was designed to be as high flow as possible while still being inexpensive.</p>

		<p>The final product is shown above. The scuba tank was obtained incredibly inexpensively because it was manufactured in 1979 and most places refuse to hydrostaticly test any tank over 30 years old. Despite this, it was in what appeared to be pristine condition. The tank was hydrostatically tested at 850psi using CO2, giving us a maximum allowable pressure of 510psi with a 1.66 factor of safety. </p>
		
		<p>A parts list, broken down by category, is shown in the table below.</p>
